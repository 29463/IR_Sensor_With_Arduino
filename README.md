Applications of IR Sensors with LEDs
1.	Automatic Lights:
o	Turn on LEDs when motion or an object is detected.
2.	Obstacle Avoidance:

Working Principle
The IR sensor emits infrared light from an LED. When an object comes into range, the emitted light reflects back to the sensor’s receiver module. Based on the intensity of the reflected light, the sensor determines the presence of an object. This output signal can control an LED using the Arduino.

Circuit Diagram
1.	Connect the VCC and GND pins of the IR sensor to the 5V and GND pins of the Arduino, respectively.
2.	Connect the OUT pin of the IR sensor to D2 on the Arduino.
3.	Connect the anode (+) of the LED to a 220-ohm resistor.
4.	Connect the other end of the resistor to D3 on the Arduino.
5.	Connect the cathode (-) of the LED to the Arduino GND.
How the Code Works
1.	Pin Initialization:
o	IR sensor is set to input mode to read its digital signal.
o	LED is set to output mode to control its state.
2.	Sensor Reading:
o	The digitalRead() function checks the state of the IR sensor.
o	If the sensor output is HIGH, it indicates object detection.
3.	LED Control:
o	The LED is turned on (HIGH) or off (LOW) based on the sensor state.
4.	Serial Monitoring:
o	Prints "Object Detected" or "No Object Detected" to the Serial Monitor for debugging.

Testing the Setup
1.	Upload the Code:
o	Connect the Arduino to your PC and upload the code using the Arduino IDE.
2.	Monitor the Output:
o	Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set baud rate to 9600).
o	Observe messages indicating object presence.
3.	Check the LED:
o	The LED should turn on when an object is within the IR sensor’s range and off otherwise.

Troubleshooting Tips
1.	No Detection:
o	Check the power connections of the IR sensor.
o	Adjust the potentiometer on the IR sensor to tune sensitivity.
2.	Incorrect LED Behavior:
o	Verify the GPIO pin assignments in the code and hardware connections.
3.	Serial Monitor Shows Incorrect Values:
o	Ensure the baud rate in the Serial Monitor matches the Serial.begin() value in the code.
